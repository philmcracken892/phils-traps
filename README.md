🪓 RedM Hunting Trap System - Player Guide
Welcome to the Bear Trap System in our RedM server! This feature allows players to place traps and catch animals in the wild. Read this guide to learn how to use it effectively and responsibly.

🧰 How to Use Bear Traps
Placing a Trap

Use the appropriate trap item from your inventory.

Find a good hunting location (open areas or animal paths work best).

Place the trap on the ground where animals are likely to pass.

Waiting for Capture

After placement, animals may eventually wander into the trap.

You’ll be notified when a trap successfully captures an animal.

Animal Captures

Once triggered, you'll get a message saying an animal has been caught.

Traps do not provide direct rewards like meat or pelts at this time (subject to change).

This system is currently for immersion, RP, and tracking purposes.

⚠️ Trap Durability
Each trap can capture up to 3 animals before it breaks.

Once a trap breaks, it is removed from the world.

You will receive a notification when your trap is no longer usable.

📦 Items & Inventory
Traps must be in your inventory to be placed.

Make sure to stock up before heading out on a hunt.

🔒 Server Rules & Tips
Do not spam traps in populated areas or near towns.

Respect hunting zones and other players' traps.

Be mindful of wildlife and roleplay when retrieving animals.
